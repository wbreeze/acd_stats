Description:
  The grades given by judges are discrete, however ordinal.
  When a judge awards a grade to fewer than five pilots, in order to do
  a Chi-Squared goodness of fit test, the instances of that grade must be
  merged with an adjacent grade. This process must iterate until there are
  five instances for each grade group. The code here does that using a full
  scan of the possible groupings, following a heuristic of smallest first,
  and bounded by largest possible number of groupings.
