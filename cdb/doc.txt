    The database is organized in a very hierarchal manner:
    Contests contain categories which contain flight programs.
    Flight programs contain results for pilots and judges.
    Flight programs contain the detailed grading record of
    grades given by each judge to each pilot for each figure.
    
    This package is limited to methods for querying the CDB and organizing the
    results into data frames.  The CDB raw interface is a RESTful one that returns
    JSON data strings.  This package is a fairly thin layer over the RESTful
    JSON interface.
