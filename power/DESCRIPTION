Description: Judge grade data is rounded on the scale from zero to ten in
 increments of 0.5. We simulate data and run GOF to normal tests in order to
 determine the cutoff points for accepting or rejecting hypothesis of fit.
 We determine cutoff points for data set sizes from twelve to sixty, and
 the percentages of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and
 false negatives resulting at those cutoff points.
