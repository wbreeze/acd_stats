\section{Judge grade distributions for all figures}

We now look at distributions of all of the grades given by a judge for
a given flight-- all pilots and all figures. We look only at flights for
which there were more than five pilots and more than eleven grades given.

We also look only at flights in which all of the pilots flew the same figures.
To do so, we select for the flight format, taking only Known, Unknown, second
unknown, second and third known flights. The distribution of flight formats is
as follows:

\begin{tabular}{r r r r r r}
Known & Unknown & Unknown II  &  Flight 1  & Flight 2 & Flight 3  \\
1488  & 1160 & 27  & 19  & 78 & 78  \\
\end{tabular}

In all, we look at 2,615 powered flights and 235 glider flights. The flights
breakdown by category is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{r r r r r}
primary  & sportsman & intermediate  &  advanced  & unlimited  \\
    229  &      1264 &          854  &       444  &        59  \\
\end{tabular}

Pilot count is the number of pilots who participated in a flight.
Grade count is the number of pilots times the number of figures, equals
the number of grades given by a judge for all of the figures and pilots in
a flight. Their distributions in this data set are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{r | r r r r r r}
& Min. & 1st Qu. & Median & Mean & 3rd Qu. & Max. \\
Pilot Count &  6 &  7 &  8 & 9.348 &  11 &  26 \\
Grade Count & 35 & 64 & 81 & 94.97 & 110 & 359 \\
\end{tabular}

The correlations between the four measures are strong, with the exception
of Lilifords to Shapioro-Wilk. Find their values in Table \ref{table:allcorr}.

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{l | r r r r}
& sw.p.value & lf.p.value & ad.p.value & cvm.p.value \\
 \hline
sw.p.value   & 1.000  & 0.417  & 0.795   & 0.613 \\
lf.p.value   & 0.417  & 1.000  & 0.696   & 0.809 \\
ad.p.value   & 0.795  & 0.696  & 1.000   & 0.935 \\
cvm.p.value  & 0.613  & 0.809  & 0.935   & 1.000 \\
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

Table \ref{table:allsumm} shows summary results from the various goodness
of fit tests.
The numbers for measures found to be valid and invalid cover all of the
results.
The other two columns contain counts of p-value results from valid measures
greater than and less than or equal to the traditional cutoff of 0.05.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l | r r r r}
& Invalid & Valid & $> 0.05$ & $<= 0.05$ \\
 \hline
chiSq.t.p   & 1243 & 1607 &  966 &  641 \\
chiSq.d.p   & 1243 & 1607 &  851 &  756 \\
sw.p.value  &    0 & 2850 &  122 & 2728 \\
lf.p.value  &    0 & 2850 &   36 & 2814 \\
ad.p.value  &    0 & 2850 &   35 & 2815 \\
cvm.p.value &    0 & 2850 &   51 & 2799 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{All figure GOF measure p-value summary}

\end{table}

The null hypothesis for these tests is that the distributions fit a normal
distribution. Using the traditional cutoff,
the Chi-Squared test finds no support for fit to normal roughly half the time.
The other tests almost always find no support for fit to normal.

We can go deeper by looking at the distributions of p-values and then
looking at some specific examples within the various quantiles.

Table \ref{table:alldist} shows the spread of p-values from the various tests.
The numbers are from only those tests reported as valid.
The minimum values from the data are always zero, and so omitted from the table.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l | r r r r r r}
& 1st Qu. & Median &  Mean & 3rd Qu. &  Max. \\
 \hline
chiSq.t.p & 0.006 & 0.124 & 0.272 & 0.492 & 0.999 \\
chiSq.d.p & 0.002 & 0.067 & 0.216 & 0.358 & 0.993 \\
sw.p.value & 0.012e-04 & 0.914e-04 & 0.837e-02 & 0.229e-02 & 0.452 \\
lf.p.value & 0.0 & 9.700e-07 & 2.453e-03 & 1.246e-04 & 2.208e-01 \\
ad.p.value & 2.000e-08 & 7.350e-06 & 2.694e-03 & 3.441e-04 & 1.912e-01 \\
cvm.p.value & 4.400e-07 & 2.989e-05 & 3.383e-03 & 6.480e-04 & 2.781e-01 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{All figure GOF measure p-value distributions}
\label{table:alldist}
\end{table}

Note that except for Chi-Squared, the mean value is greater than the
third quantile value,
demonstating that more than three-quarters of the values fall below the mean.
