\section{Measurements}
We apply a number of standard measures of goodness of fit. The measures used
are Chi-Square, Anderson-Darling, Shapiro-Wilk, Lilifords, and Cramer-von Mises.

The data is rounded. A judge does not have a continuous range between
zero and ten, but must round to the nearest half grade. This means that
it must either be treated as discrete, using buckets as with Chi-Square,
or given random perturbations in order to make them continuous.

The full data set, together with R code for retrieval and analysis, is
available from \cite{acdstats}.
