\begin{abstract}
  In the sport of competition aerobatics, pilots fly combinations of loops,
  rolls, and other maneuvers in high performance airplanes, in front of
  judges observing from the ground.
  The judges quantify the quality of the loop and roll combinations
  using grades.

  At the world level, a statistical
  scoring system treats judge grades as if they are normally distributed,
  in an attempt to detect and eliminate biases among the judges
  and produce scores that rank the pilots.

  This paper reports goodness of fit to the normal distribution of
  grades given by judges in 2710 flight programs from IAC contests
  during six years from 2014 to 2019, and reports the results.
  The measurements show poor fit to the grades of the judges.
  The poor fit for the normal distribution challenges
  the validity of the statistical scoring system and the results produced
  by it.
