\begin{abstract}
  The sport of competition aerobatics is flown by pilots and graded by
  judges observing from the ground.
  Aerobatic competitions at the world level are scored using a statistical
  scoring system that treats judge grades as if they are normally distributed.
  This paper measures goodness of fit to the normal distribution of
  grades given by judges in 2710 flight programs from IAC contests
  during six years from 2014 to 2019, and reports the results.
