\begin{abstract}
  The sport of competition aerobatics is flown by pilots and graded by
  judges observing from the ground.
  Aerobatic competitions at the world level are scored using a statistical
  scoring system that treats judge grades as if they are normally distributed.
  This paper reports goodness of fit to normal for judge grades from a large
  number of aerobatic contests.
