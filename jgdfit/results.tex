\section{Judge Grade Distributions}

We can now look at the goodness of fit measured results.
We measured in two ways. First, we measured fit to all of
the grades given by a judge for a particular flight. This results in more
grades; however, those grades are given to a large variety of figures of
all basic types and difficulties within the category graded.

Second, we measured fit to grades from FPS figure groups. The FPS groups
grades according to the figure graded. When there are fewer than
a dozen pilots, FPS combines grades given to figures of similar difficulty such
that there are a minimum of a dozen grades in a figure group.

In both cases, we look only at flights for
which there were more than five pilots and more than eleven grades given.
We also look only at flights in which all of the pilots flew the same figures.
To do so, we select for the flight format, taking only Known, Unknown, second
unknown, first flights.
